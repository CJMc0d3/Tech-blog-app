# Tech-blog-app
This is a tech blog app for adding posts and commenting on posts.

I used many dependancies including:
Path, Express, Express-Session, Express-handlebars, mySQL, Dotenv, and connect-session sequelize.

If you would like to login, use the username of: "Cam" with the password: "password".

This will allow you full access to the sight to be able to look at past posts, and comment on them or create your own new posts for other users to comment on.
